#The Ruby Group CRUD App!
For this challenge you will have two hours to finish the following app. You can use any resources you want, with the exception of other DBC students (i.e. you may ask instructors or alumni, but not other current students).


You have graduated from Dev Bootcamp and are looking for work, but you have no money, so you start freelancing to make some extra cash on the side. A client approaches you and offers to hire you to build her foundation - The Ruby Group - a CRUD webapp so they can post about meetings, create work groups, and offer help based on their own Ruby skillsets. Naturally as a poor, underfunded DBC grad you gladly take the job!

* A user can be in many groups
* A group has an owner, members, and a topic
* A user can be in many meetings
* A meeting has a leader, attendees, and a meeting time
