#The Ruby Group CRUD App!
For this challenge you will have two hours to finish the following app. You can use any resources you want, with the exception of other DBC students (i.e. you may ask instructors or alumni, but not other current students).


You have graduated from Dev Bootcamp and are looking for work, but you have no money, so you start freelancing to make some extra cash on the side. A client approaches you and offers to hire you to build her foundation - The Ruby Group - a CRUD webapp so they can post about meetings and create work groups. Naturally as a poor, underfunded DBC grad you gladly take the job!

##Release 0
To begin you have to get your associations straight, your client has specified a number of requirements for the database to have:
* There needs to be three main tables - Users, Groups, and Meetings
* A user can be in many groups
* A group has an owner, members, description, and a topic
* A user can be in many meetings
* A meeting has a leader, attendees, description, and a meeting time
* A User has all of the groups they own, the groups they're in, the meetings they lead, the meetings they attend, their Ruby Skills, a profile picture, and an Email/Password for log in

##Release 1
Now that you have you database it's time to do your views! Your client tells you that they want there to be all of the following pages:
* A Main Page that shows all of the created groups and meetings (each in their own column, side-by-side, with the Owner/Leader and Topic/Time). Each one should link to the Group/ Meeting specific Page.
* A Specific Page for each group/meeting that shows the Owner/ Leader (by profile pic), the description, and all of the members/ attedees (again, by profile pic). Your client has specified that they want the members to be in a 3-column layout.
* A Profile page for each user that shows all their information
